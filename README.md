# Maroon-Bells-Survey-Analysis

### Overview: 

This is a project with Maroon Bells to categorize approximately 5,000 survey responses into useful categories for planning and evaluation of a shuttle and reservation system at the area. 


### Categories:

| Category |	Description |
| ----------| ----------------- |
| Access |	Opportunities and challenges with access to/within Bells for different user groups, including people with disabilities and early morning users (e.g., hikers, photographers) access challenges due to parking capacity, site schedule hours, affordability, and mobility limitations; outfitters and guides providing access |
| Access for Locals |	Ensuring access for local residents
| Activity Permits	| Backpacking, wilderness, and other activity permits including for outfitter and guides
| Alternative Transportation	| Accommodations for trail, bicycle (traditional and e-bikes), and bus users
| Concerns with Dogs | Dogs off leash; dogs attacking wildlife; dog feces
| Congestion	| Increased visitation; visitor volume; crowding; concerns with overuse
| Cost	| Cost of backpacking and parking; affordable access
| Equity	| "Ensuring access for lower income residents, non-English speakers, people with disabilities, and other underserved populations; barriers to visitation include pricing; monolingual reservation website, signage, and traveler information; digital access, and physiological barriers (e.g., accessible facilities)"
| Infrastructure and Facilities	| Condition of existing facilities; inadequate or lack of facilities to support visitor safety and mobility (e.g., seperated bike lane)
| Litter/Waste	| Visitors leaving trash and human feces
| Management and Coordination	| Strong stakeholder partnerships; volunteer support; limited resources and staffing to maintain/manage facilities and enforce rules
| Modal Conflicts	| Conflict(s) between different modal users (motorists, bicyclists, pedestrians, transit)
| Natural Resources and Scenic Quality	| Invasive species; pollution; preserve scenic views; people feeding animals; concerns with overdevelopment
| Parking	| Inadequate parking available; desire for increased parking options
| Reservation System	| Parking passes; planned vs. spontaneous visits; complex trip planning/booking process; online resources inadequate
| Safety	| Unsafe hiking and trail behavior; vehicle and bike safety; outfitter and guide communication
| Technology	| Drones use
| User Experience	| Winter access; campsite management; balance different uses/activities
| Visitor Education	| Unprepared visitors; varying levels of biking/hiking/camping etiquette; online resources inadequate
| Wayfinding 	| Inaccurate/inadequate or lack of signage and directions; limited information on terrain level re: ease or difficulty
| Winter Activites	| Opportunities for winter-based recreational activities and related issues (e.g., avalance, snow removal)
